## Contributing

Please follow the (Ticket Template)[https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan/blob/7.x-1.x/CONTRIBUTING.md#new-feature-template] when creating new tickets.

Also, please remember to reference the issue across repositories in order for maintainers to pick up commits and pull requests looking at the issue. You can do that for commits like this:

```bash
git commit -m "Issue NuCivic/dkan_feedback#<issue_number>: ..."
```

Just replace **<issue_number>** with the actual issue number. You can reference pull requests exactly like that if you add the same text **"NuCivic/dkan_feedback#<issue_number>"** in a comment.

This really help us detecting changes and pulling them in in faster.
